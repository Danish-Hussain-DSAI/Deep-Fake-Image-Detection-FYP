Overview   
The project "Deep Fake Image Detection Using Deep Learning" aims to develop an advanced system capable of automatically identifying and detecting deep fake images in digital media. Deep fake technology has become increasingly sophisticated, posing significant risks in various domains such as misinformation, fraud, and privacy invasion. Thus, the project endeavours to address this challenge by leveraging deep learning techniques to create a robust detection system.

Aim of Project 
The aim of the project "Deep Fake Image Detection Using Deep Learning" is to develop a system or model capable of identifying and detecting deep fake images, which are digitally manipulated images created using deep learning techniques. Deep fake images are created by applying advanced machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning, to alter or superimpose images or videos in a highly realistic manner, often with the intent to deceive or mislead.
 
Objectives of Project 
The objectives of this project are:  
 Developing a Deep Learning Model:
Create a deep learning model capable of detecting deep fake images by learning patterns and features indicative of manipulation.

Exploring Deep Learning Architectures:
Investigate various deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and more or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to determine the most effective approach for deep fake detection.

Model Training and Optimization:
Train the deep learning model on the prepared dataset using appropriate optimization techniques to achieve high detection accuracy and minimize false positives.

Performance Evaluation:
Evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate validation or test dataset to assess its effectiveness in detecting deep fake images.

Integration Techniques:

integrate the model using streamlit library.

Implementation of Practical Application:
Implement the trained model into a practical application or tool that can automatically identify deep fake images in real-time or batch processing scenarios, making it accessible for widespread use.
Testing and Validation: Conduct thorough testing and validation of the detection system to ensure its reliability and effectiveness in different scenarios and against various types of deep fake manipulation.
